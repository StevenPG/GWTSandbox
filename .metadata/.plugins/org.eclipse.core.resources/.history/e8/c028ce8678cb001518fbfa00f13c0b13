How To Play:
	To play, enter a value at the prompt when shown.
	Here are the gameplay steps:
	1. Select a card from the numbered grid
	2. Select a second card to guess if it is identical.
	3. Read output, and use your memory to decide on your next card.
	4. Repeat 1-3 until the game is over.
	
	Note:
		Entering -2 will end the game prematurely.
		You may cheat because the game is too hard by entering -1.
			(Be careful, the game is unaware you are
			 cheating and might get confused. 
			 It will undoubtedly recover and work fine though.)
