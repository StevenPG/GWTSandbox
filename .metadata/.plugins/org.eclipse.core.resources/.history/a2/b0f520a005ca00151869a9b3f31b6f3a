Class notes:
MemoryCard.java:
	1. This class is functionally immutable, the only mutable value is the ability to
	   flip a card. Internally, this just flips a boolean that determines what gets printed.
	2. Memorycards are able to be drawn as a card based on this boolean bit.

MemoryGameBoard:
	1. Rather than using a 2D array, the game board is internally held with one
	   arraylist, allowing for any size game to be played based on the initial cardList.
	   Passing 20 cards in will create a 40 card game, while passing 10 will create a 20
	   card game.
	2. The game does not care if the caller passes duplicate cards. This is just considered
	   an easy mode as there would be 4 of each card instead of 2, making a higher chance
	   for a match.
